            <h2>PRESENTAION</h2>
             <p>
                 This site is designed for a Sience museum called "COMMUNITY SCIENCE MUSEUM". 
                 The target audience is primary and middle school children and families.
             </p>
             <p>The site should look exciting and interesting. It should attract kids and parents to come and vitit and explore in the museum.</p>
             <p>This was my first semester project and we were only allowed to use HTM & CSS.</p>

            <h2>PROCESS</h2>
       <p>
           The site should look exciting so i chose bright colors for this site. 
           I also made a plan so that i could finish this project in time.
           For planning my project i made a gant chart and a trello board so i could have a better overview of my process.
       </p>
       <p>
           I like to make a prototype before i start any project, just to have a better overview over what im going to make.
           I had some issues with my picture wich i chose for my homepage, i hade issues with the quality so i had to change it.
           </p>
           <p>Overall the process for making this site went well. I was more comfortable in what i was doing. When i was creating this project
               i was 4 months into this course and we had covered a huge part of HTML & CSS. But you can never learn enough, right?

            <h2>EVALUATION</h2>

            <p>
                If i recreated this website today i would have changed a couple of things.
                I would have placed the menu at the top, paralell to the logo.
                I would have kept the colour of the navigation bar because it matches with the homepage picture and the logo.
                But i would make an active state in the navigation bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a lot of good white space but i would have made the diffrent elements more presentable.
                    For example, change the size on the images, put some CSS to the pictures for example box-shadowing and aligned
                     the text properly and kept the text short in width as well.
                     I would maybe change the colour of the footer as well and add some more relevant content to it.
                     </p>
